DEFAULT USERS LOGIN DETAILS:
email - test@gmail.com
password - test123

DEFAULT ADMIN LOGIN DEATILS:

## System Configuration.

I have used SQlite database where products, users and orders will be stored.
The database will be created once the project is executed and sample products and users will be added.

I have added sample products, users into the database.

## How to run project

I HAVE USED BOOTSTRAP FOR STYLING THAT NEEDS NETWORK ACCESS TO LOAD BOOTSTRAP CDN.

Open Eclipse, right click the IDE and select "Open Project"

Select this project folder and click open.

Select the shopping-cart-application and select "Open Project"

Right click the shoping-cart-application and select "Build with dependencies"

Inside the WebApp folder open index.jsp and run using any server.

Once the server has started it will start browser.

IMPORTANT! - BEFORE RUNNING THE PROJECT ENSURE THAT SERVER IS INSTALLED.
